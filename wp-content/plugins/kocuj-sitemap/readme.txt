Display a sitemap by shortcode, widget or PHP function. Multilingualism (qTranslate X plugin) is supported. WP and WP Multisite.

== Description ==

*Kocuj Sitemap* plugin adds shortcode `[KocujSitemap]` that puts the sitemap in the place where it is located. This allows you to display links to all of your posts, pages, menu items, authors, tags and custom types entries anywhere on your website - even within the article. There is also a PHP function that allows you to place the sitemap anywhere on the website. There is also possibility to use the widget to place a sitemap anywhere in the sidebar.

This plugin supports multilingual websites. If you have installed the plugin compatible with *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin (currently it is *qTranslate X*), the plugin will generate a sitemap on your website in accordance with the currently selected language. If you do not have the plugin that supports multilingualism, *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin will display a sitemap for the default language defined for your WordPress installation.

The sitemap is automatically generated and stored in the cache, which is used in the sitemap to avoid using the database when loading your website, after each change of any element in the administration panel (for example, when you change a post). This process speeds up the loading of the sitemap on your website.

The *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin can be used in standard or in multisite WordPress installation.

= Features =

* Compatibility with HTML 5,
* Multilingual websites support (with qTranslate X plugin),
* Fast operation due to use of the cache,
* Displaying posts, pages, menu items, authors, tags and custom types entries (with custom taxonomies),
* Displaying all elements with dividing it by sections or without it,
* Ability to change order of displayed entries,
* Ability to exclude selected entries,
* Ability to hide selected element types, for example, all posts,
* Easily adding of the sitemap by using a shortcode with help of HTML or visual editor button,
* Possibility to set left margin for each level in multi-level sitemap if theme has problems with displaying such a list,
* Many configuration options,
* Many filters for better control of the plugin.

= Requirements =

This plugin requires PHP 5.x (from 5.3) or PHP 7.x and WordPress 4.8 or greater. It works in standard and multisite WordPress environments. It is strongly recommended to use WordPress in the newest version.

= How to use =

There are few possibilities to display the sitemap:
* by using a shortcode `[KocujSitemap]` inside a post of any type,
* by displaying a widget,
* by using the PHP function anywhere in the code, for example, inside a theme.

The shortcode `[KocujSitemap]` has optional parameters:

* `homelinktext` - text that will be used as the text for the link to the main page,
* `class` - name of the style sheet class that will be added to the block element (`div` or `nav`) containing the entire sitemap,
* `excludepost` - comma separated list of identifiers for posts of any type (posts, pages, custom types entries) to exclude,
* `excludecategory` - comma separated list of identifiers for post categories to exclude,
* `excludeauthor` - comma separated list of identifiers for authors to exclude,
* `excludeterm` - comma separated list of identifiers for post categories, post tags or custom taxonomies to exclude,
* `hidetypes` - comma separated list of element types to hide; it can contains the following types: "author" (to hide authors), "custom" (to hide custom post types), "home" (to hide link to homepage), "menu" (to hide menus), "page" (to hide pages), "post" (to hide posts), "tag" (to hide tags).

For example, if you use `[KocujSitemap homelinktext="NEW LINK TEXT" class="new_class"]`, the sitemap will be displayed in the block element (`div` or `nav`) with the CSS class `new_class` and link to the home page with text `NEW LINK TEXT`.

If you add other parameters, for example `[KocujSitemap homelinktext="NEW LINK TEXT" class="new_class" excludepost="5,6" excludeterm="12" hidetypes="page"]`, the sitemap will be displayed in the block element (`div` or `nav`) with the CSS class `new_class`, link to the home page with text `NEW LINK TEXT`, there will be not displayed posts of any type with identifiers 5 and 6 and post tags and custom taxonomies with identifier 12 and all pages will be not displayed.

Instead of using the shortcode, you can edit the PHP file responsible for the theme. *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin defines global PHP function which declaration is as follows: `<?php function kocujsitemap_show_sitemap($homeLinkText = '', $class = '', array $exclude = array(), array $hideTypes = array()); ?>`. The parameters `$homeLinkText` and `$class` perform the same function as the corresponding parameters in the shortcode `[KocujSitemap]`.

For example, if you use `<?php kocujsitemap_show_sitemap('NEW LINK TEXT', 'new_class'); ?>`, the sitemap will be displayed in the block element (`div` or `nav`) with the CSS class `new_class` and link to the home page with text `NEW LINK TEXT`.

More things should be sayed about `$exclude` parameter. It should contains an array of identifiers categorized (with correct key identifier) by entry type to exclude. There are the following entries types available:

* `post` - for excluding posts of any type (posts, pages, custom types entries),
* `category` - for excluding post categories,
* `author` - for excluding authors,
* `term` - for excluding post categories, post tags or custom taxonomies.

For example, the `$exclude` array containing `array('post' => array(5, 6), 'term' => array(12))` will exclude posts of any type with identifiers 5 and 6 and post tags and custom taxonomies with identifier 12.

The parameter $hideTypes has list of elements types to hide. It can contains the following types: "author" (to hide authors), "custom" (to hide custom post types), "home" (to hide link to homepage), "menu" (to hide menus), "page" (to hide pages), "post" (to hide posts), "tag" (to hide tags).

For example, the `$hideTypes` array containing `array('post', 'page')` will hide all posts and pages.

There is also possibility to use widget. It has possibility to display the sitemap as standard or drop-down list. It has also the possibility to exclude selected elements or hide the selected elements types from the sitemap.

= Configuration =

There is option *Sitemap* in the administration panel, which is used to configure the behavior of the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin. If you select any submenu item from the *Sitemap* menu, you will find yourself in a place where you can set specific options for the plugin.

The settings on each administration page are divided into tabs. There can be active only one tab at once. Tab is selected by clicking on its name.

Each tab contains a set of options. Each option has a description that is displayed when you set mouse cursor over it. You can also see more detailed information by clicking a *Help* button on top of the page.

Changes in the configuration can be saved by clicking on the *Save settings* button. There is a possibility to restore the settings that were set after installing the plugin, by selecting an option *Restore settings* in the plugin menu.

Remember, that removing the plugin will clean all its options saved into the database.

= CSS classes =

The *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin displays a sitemap using a few CSS classes, so you can customize the look of the sitemap to your requirements.

There are the following CSS classes available:

* `kocujsitemap` - used by main container for the sitemap (`nav` or `div`) in shortcode, PHP function and widget,
* `kocujsitemapwidget` - used by main container for the sitemap (`nav` or `div`) in the widget,
* `kocujsitemap-home` - used by `<li>` element in the sitemap when the link is to the home page,
* `kocujsitemap-post` - used by `<li>` element in the sitemap when the link is to the post of any type (post, page, custom type entry),
* `kocujsitemap-category` - used by `<li>` element in the sitemap when the link is to the post category,
* `kocujsitemap-term` - used by `<li>` element in the sitemap when the link is to the post tags or custom taxonomy,
* `kocujsitemap-author` - used by `<li>` element in the sitemap when the link is to the author,
* `kocujsitemap-unknown` - used by `<li>` element in the sitemap when the link is to something different than all above (for example, link to other website).

= Planned features =

* Generating one sitemap for all blogs in multisite installation,
* Creating more than one sitemap,
* Easy control of shortcode parameters in HTML and visual editor,
* Generating XML sitemap for search engines.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Some questions below are from users of this plugin and some are from author of this plugin as supplement to the documentation.

= How can I add question about this plugin? =

Please send a question to author at [http://kocujsitemap.wpplugin.kocuj.pl/contact/](http://kocujsitemap.wpplugin.kocuj.pl/contact/).

= Why this plugin is compatible only with last two versions of WordPress? =

There is too often the situation when old version of WordPress is used and no one performs updates. No update of WordPress makes it difficult for plugin developers (such as *Kocuj Sitemap*) to do technical support and backward compatibility. Therefore, I have decided that only 2 versions of WordPress will be supported - the newest and previous. For example, when the latest WordPress version is 4.3, then versions 4.2 and 4.3 will be supported.

But what should do people with old versions of WordPress? The answer is simple - to update.

Please be aware that an outdated version of WordPress is nothing more but trouble. Sooner or later your website will get hacked. Therefore, WordPress update process should be performed as often as possible.

But why people do not update their WordPress installations? There are often the same few reasons. I will try to argue with them below.

* *Plugin, which we are using, will stop working:* If a plugin author abandoned it and no longer provides updates, you should look for another plugin that provides the same or similar functionality. You possibly can, in order to repair this, hire a specialist who will repair the plugin, find another plugin or write his own solution. Sometimes it turns out that plugin, that is not marked by its author as working in the latest version of WordPress, works fine. So you should test it.
* *Theme or the entire site will be inoperable:* If your theme is not working correctly in the latest version of WordPress, please contact with its author and determine the conditions for correcting these bugs. Alternatively, as in the case of plugin, you may employ a specialist, who will repair a theme.
* *My changes in WordPress core will be lost:* Never, ever, do not change anything in WordPress core! At first update of WordPress core, all your changes will be lost! If you need some change in WordPress, you should find plugin with the appropriate functionality.

If, despite these arguments, you still want to have the old version of WordPress, then you will not can use latest versions of *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin. Of course, you can try, but author of this plugin can't guarantee that all of its functionality will be working correctly.

= How to create more than one sitemap? =

It is not possible to create more than one sitemap on one website. The only possibility to do this is to have a multisite WordPress installation and add the sitemap to each site in network individually.

The idea for this plugin was to create one global sitemap with links to all neccessary places. However, because some people need multiple sitemaps, this feature is planned for one of the future version of this plugin. More information will be available when it will be added to plugin development schedule.

= I can see wrong links titles and some entries are not displayed in the sitemap. What should I do? =

Sometimes some plugins can change some content used in the sitemap, for example, post title. It is very rare situation, however it is possible.

There is possibility to update the content and also to make sure that it will not happen again. You can go to the administration settings for the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin (submenu *Basic settings*) and click on the *Save settings* button. During the saving of settings there is a process of recreating the cache, so the new content will be used from this moment.

To make sure that it will not happen again you can disable the cache. It is strongly not recommended, because it can slow down the loading of the website and it will use more resources to get data from database. However, if you see that one of your plugins is changing the content, you should disable the cache to prevent displaying a wrong data in your sitemap. To do so you should go to the administration settings for the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin (submenu *Basic settings*), click on the tab *Troubleshooting*, uncheck the option *Enable cache* and click on the *Save settings* button. From now on the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin will not be used cache.

= My multi-level sitemap has no indentations. What should I do? =

Sometimes the multi-level sitemap is displayed without additional left margins. It is not this plugin fault, but it is problem in your theme! This plugin does not create the sitemap appearance. It is task for your theme. When this problem occurs, it is not relate only to the sitemap, but to all multi-level lists on your website. You should contact with your theme author and he should fix this bug.

If you can't fix this problem for some reason (author of theme is unavailable, he can't fix the bug, etc.), the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin has the solution. However, this solution is only for the sitemap - problems with all other multi-level lists will not be corrected in any way. To fix the problem with multi-level sitemap, you should go to the administration settings for the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin (submenu *Basic settings*), click on the tab *Troubleshooting*, enter the required left margin in field *Force left margin in pixels for each level on multi-level list* and click on the *Save settings* button.

= How can I remove duplicates from the sitemap? =

In case of menus, there is possibility to have duplicates, because different menus can have some entries the same as others. If you want to remove this duplicates from the sitemap, you should go to the menus settings for the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin (submenu *Menus list options*), click on the tab *Options*, check the option *Remove menu items duplicates from sitemap* and click on the *Save settings* button.

= The sitemap looks strange. What should I do? =

The look of the sitemap is not a functionality of the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin, but the theme which is used on your website. The sitemap use correct HTML tags, so with any theme it will be look like it should be.

There can be one possibility for problems with the sitemap look. You should check if your theme is created in HTML 5. If not, you have to make sure that sitemap is also not generated as HTML 5. To do so you should go to the administration settings for the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin (submenu *Basic settings*), click on the tab *Sitemap format*, uncheck the option *Use HTML 5 tags* and click on the *Save menus list options* button.

= I have a multi-lingual plugin, but my sitemap is only in one language - the default for my WordPress installation. Why? =

First of all you should check if your multi-lingual plugin is supported by the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin. For now there is one multi-lingual plugin which is used: qTranslate X. Remember, that any fork of these plugins can also not working, because there can be some changes in classes or functions names. The *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin guarantees full cooperation only with this one plugin at this time - any other plugin can be ignored or worked only partially.

However, if you are using one of the supported plugins and you have some problems, you should check if you have no more than one multi-lingual plugin installed and activated. It is always a bad idea to use more than one multi-lingual plugin at once. However, if you have any reason to use more than one multi-lingual plugin at once, you should do some checks in the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin settings. To do so go to the administration settings for the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin (submenu *Basic settings*), click on the tab *Plugins for multilingualism* and check which multi-lingual plugin is displayed as *Currently used plugin*. If you want to change it, you should select the required multi-lingual plugin in the *Use plugin for multiple languages* option and click on the *Save settings* button.

There is also possibility to have some other plugin which interferes with your content. There is possibility to update the content and also to make sure that it will not happen again. You can go to the administration settings for the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin (submenu *Basic settings*) and click on the *Save settings* button. During the saving of settings there is a process of recreating the cache, so the new content will be used from this moment.

To make sure that it will not happen again you can disable the cache. It is strongly not recommended, because it can slow down the loading of the website and it will use more resources to get data from database. However, if you see that one of your plugins is changing the content, you should disable the cache to prevent displaying a wrong data in your sitemap. To do so you should go to the administration settings for the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin (submenu *Basic settings*), click on the tab *Troubleshooting*, uncheck the option *Enable cache* and click on the *Save settings* button. From now on the *Kocuj Sitemap* plugin will not be used cache.
