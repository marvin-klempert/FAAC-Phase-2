This plugin adds functionality required to fully take advantage of the FAAC Incorporated theme. Post types, custom fields via ACF, etc.

== Description ==
This plugin adds functionality required to fully take advantage of the FAAC Incorporated theme. This includes extra post types, Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) integration, and other bells and whistles not included in the FAAC Incorporated theme by default.

== Installation ==
Honestly, you probably shouldn't be installing this if you don't know what you're doing. It's a custom plugin with no expectation of distribution, so only direct copying of files has been used and tested.

== Changelog ==
0.8 - Restructured field groups for easier organization and navigation

0.7 - Added Vimeo API support

0.6 - Removed ACF groups for continued development

0.5 - Added field groups back in

0.4 - Reworked options from the ground up

0.3 - Added Testimonials post type

0.2 - Updated options layout

0.1 - Created the basic outline of the plugin and its functionality.
